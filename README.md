# dot-files
# parts of this setup are stolen and edited from diinki's retrofuture which i used as a base for this setup
# with some added hotkeys and wallpapers and different colors as well as some customization for a few apps 
# not included in diinkis setup like: qbit calibre and spotify
# the below text is copyy pasted from their readme but im adding some of the other programs youll need to run
# this version.

# Run sudo pacman -S sway wofi waybar nemo nautilus kitty dconf dconf-editor in your terminal.
# Run yay eww in your terminal (you will need to install yay).
# Install the Maple Mono font, as this font is used a lot in this Linux rice. Move the font-file to /usr/share/fonts, then run fc-cache -f -v to update the fonts.
# ===================================================================== #
# okay heres other programs you need to make this setup work with my config:
# qBittorrent
# sssw (this is a github project to cache gifs to reduce cpu in running animated wallpapers unfortunately my gifs were too big to upload here but check out waneella for more good art)
# calibre
# spotify
# spicetfy (spotify + spicetify takes some setup to get working)
# swayidle 
# swaylock

# ====================================================================== #

# Sorry this is so messy its my first try at this!
# also anything that takes a file directory for an image (re: swaylock or the main config) will need to be
# updated for YOUR images
